Obesity Risk Prediction
Project Description
This project aims to build a classification model to predict the risk of obesity based on various lifestyle and physical attributes.

Live Demo
A live Streamlit demo of the model is available here:

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Obesity Risk dataset, which can be found [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2]. It contains information about individuals including their[...]

Steps Taken
Data Loading and Initial Exploration: Loaded the dataset and performed initial checks for data types, missing values, and duplicates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the distribution of various features and explored relationships between features and the target variable (Obesity Type).
Feature Engineering: Created a new feature, BMI (Body Mass Index), based on height and weight.
Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical features through encoding (Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding) and assessed feature importance using Mutual Information and Cramer's V.
Splitting Data and Scaling: Split the data into training and testing sets and applied scaling to numerical features. SMOTE was used to address potential class imbalance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trained and evaluated several classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) on the preprocessed data.
Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation: Optimized the models using GridSearchCV and cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.
Saving the Best Model: The best performing model was saved for future use.
